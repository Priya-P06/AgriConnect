# üö® QUICK FIX: Internal Server Error on Vercel

## Problem
Your AgriConnect MVP works locally but shows "Internal Server Error" when deployed on Vercel.

## Root Cause
**Missing environment variables in production deployment.**

## ‚ö° Quick Solution (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Go to Vercel Dashboard
1. Visit [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Find and click on your **AgriConnect** project

### Step 2: Add Environment Variables
1. Click **Settings** tab
2. Click **Environment Variables** in sidebar  
3. Add these **exact** variables:

```
Variable Name: MONGODB_URI
Value: mongodb+srv://priyapremnmkl5:mlBObqUYLnQK0WUf@agriconnect.2clc19t.mongodb.net/agri_connect_db?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=AgriConnect
```

```
Variable Name: SECRET_KEY  
Value: KgxxSH0ChsvTxm4qVM6XCAi6JPenycLWPIEBfNrg8mI
```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Make sure to check all three boxes (Production, Preview, Development) for each variable.

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. Go to **Deployments** tab
2. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for completion

## ‚úÖ Test Your Fix
After redeployment, test with these accounts:

**Farmers:**
- `farmer_john` / `farmer123`
- `farmer_mary` / `farmer123` 

**Consumers:**  
- `consumer_alice` / `consumer123`
- `consumer_bob` / `consumer123`

## üîß What Was Fixed

1. **Enhanced vercel_app.py** - Better error handling and logging
2. **Improved database connection checks** - More robust error detection
3. **Added fallback environment variables** - Prevents crashes during deployment
4. **Better error messages** - Shows exactly what's missing

Your application should now work perfectly in production! üéâ
